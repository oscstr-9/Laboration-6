The goal of the game is to suvive for as long as possible. you controll the blue circle with WASD to avoid being touched by the red circles.
The red circles (the enemies) spawn one after one in random positions with random speed in a random direction so the game is never exacly the same.
You only have one life per attempt and the score is printed out in the console. Good luck!
