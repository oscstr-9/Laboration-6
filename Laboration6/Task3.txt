This lab was really fun to work on but it was quite dificult. That combined with the christmas break made it take way more time than I think I really needed.
That being said this is definitely the lab i spent the most time on, I'm not really sure of how much time though.
This lab really showed how useful getters and setter can be, especially with the double linked list. I had some issues with understanding how to even begin the
double linked list but by physically drawing what was going on I found it easier to understand. getting the circles to move without erasing them when making my game
also proved to be more difficult than expected. All in all I think the lab was great but the timing of the christmas break made it harder than it really was for me.
